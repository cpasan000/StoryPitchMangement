-implement logging and some JUnit testing

-fix bug where draft list shows up on editor page before proposals are at appropriate approval level

-notify author of changes made to a proposal by a senior editor

-for draft_list, make entries dissapear when a draft is accepted, or find a way to properly show/hide the modal buttons

-add a notice to the login screens if the entered login information isn't found in the database
-add confirmation notices everywhere for submitting things

-in modals, make the "submit" buttons either close the modal or have some sort of confirmation message

-change "Status" messages on story_form_static to be more user-friendly and reflect when a proposal has been deleted

-modify story_form_static.js so that 
    -locked proposals show as grey
    -instead of accepted proposals dissapearing, they become green (and move to the bottom of the list?)
